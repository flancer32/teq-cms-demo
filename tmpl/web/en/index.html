<h1>Tequila CMS â€” a minimalist and extensible content management system</h1>
<p>This system is designed specifically for modern projects where content is code, and localization and page generation are performed using AI.</p>
<p>Tequila CMS uses a file structure to store templates and data, ensuring transparency, version control, and easy integration with CI/CD.</p>
<p>Thanks to convention-based dependency injection and server-side rendering, you can quickly deploy a multilingual website without complex configurations.</p>
<p>The built-in automatic translation system allows generating localized pages as originals are updated, leveraging the power of LLMs.</p>
<p>To get started, use the navigation menu. You can also open a sample page or explore the project structure.</p>
