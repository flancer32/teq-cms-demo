<h1>Agent Driven Site Management (ADSM)</h1>

<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p><strong>ADSM</strong> is a way to manage a site through text instructions. You describe what pages you need and what should be on them, and the agent builds and maintains them.</p>
<p>The cognitive context is a set of files describing the project and the site structure. It helps the agent understand how the site is organized and which rules to follow.</p>

<h2>Scheme</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/schema/adsm_concept.png" alt="Interaction diagram: human → agent → site">
    <br>
    <em>A human describes the task, the agent updates the site</em>
</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>The site brings together social networks, videos and ads, so it must be updated regularly to stay useful.</p>
<p>Manual editing takes time. Developers, landing page authors and documentation writers face this constantly. ADSM removes the routine and lets you update content quickly.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>You write a text instruction: what the project is, which pages you need and what to place on them. The agent reads this text and creates or changes the site's files. You describe the goal — the agent does the work.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose you need an “About Us” page. You write: “Add an 'About Us' page with a title and a short team description.” The agent creates the page with the requested content. All interaction happens through plain text.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<table>
    <tr><th>Advantage</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Relevance</td><td>The site always matches the current project description</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Simplicity</td><td>You can update the site with plain text</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fast updates</td><td>Changes in the description instantly appear on the pages</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Language adaptation</td><td>The agent can translate and adapt content for different audiences</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Flexibility</td><td>Can be used in any environment: with files, templates or databases</td></tr>
</table>
