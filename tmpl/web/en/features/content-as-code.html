<h1>Content as Code</h1>

<p><strong>TeqCMS</strong> implements the "content as code" principle — all pages, templates and translations are stored in regular files and managed via git. This simplifies development, localization and website maintenance.</p>

<ul>
    <li>📁 HTML pages, templates and styles are regular files in the project</li>
    <li>📝 Changes are edited in your favorite editor, without a CMS interface</li>
    <li>🔀 Change history is tracked in git: you can compare, rollback, comment</li>
    <li>🤝 Collaboration with other team members works like code collaboration</li>
    <li>⚙️ Project structure matches URL structure, everything is transparent and predictable</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach is perfect for landing pages, promo sites, documentation and other projects where simplicity, control and independence from admin panels and databases are important.</p>
