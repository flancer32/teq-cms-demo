<h1>File structure instead of a database</h1>

<p><strong>TeqCMS</strong> fundamentally avoids using databases and admin panels. All website work comes down to managing files that are under version control (git).</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>tmpl/web/{locale}/</code> — localized templates and pages (HTML)</li>
    <li><code>web/</code> — static resources: images, styles, JS</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes to the base locale are made in the development environment. Then AI translation is run to create page versions for other languages. All this is committed to git: every translation, every edit remains in the commit history.</p>

<p>After committing, you can <strong>push</strong> to GitHub and deploy changes to production — manually or via GitHub Actions. This structure facilitates collaborative development, change auditing, and environment migration.</p>
