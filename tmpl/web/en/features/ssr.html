<h1>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</h1>

<p><strong>TeqCMS</strong> uses server-side rendering to generate HTML pages from templates. This
    provides fast response times, full compatibility with search engines, and predictable website behavior without
    requiring client-side JavaScript.</p>

<p>Rendering is implemented through the packages <a href="https://github.com/flancer32/teq-tmpl" target="_blank">@flancer32/teq-tmpl</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/flancer32/teq-cms" target="_blank">@flancer32/teq-cms</a>, which assemble final
    pages from template fragments. Two engines are supported: <strong>Nunjucks</strong> and <strong>Mustache</strong>,
    and the architecture allows for connecting others.</p>

<p>If a specific fragment is missing for the required locale, TeqCMS automatically uses the template from the base locale. This
    improves reliability and flexibility when working with multilingual sites.</p>

<p>Important: the locale used to display pages <strong>does not have to</strong> match the base locale from
    which translations are made. For example, translations can be made from the Russian version while displaying
    the English version as the main site version. This behavior is explicitly configurable.</p>

<p>Rendering occurs entirely on the server side, ensuring SEO optimization and easy deployment without build
    pipelines.</p>
