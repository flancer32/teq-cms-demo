{% block content %}
<p>TeqCMS is a minimalist CMS for Node.js websites with AI localization and git-based management. Created by a single developer - Alex Gusev - as an experiment: can you create multilingual websites without databases, admin panels and frameworks. All code, including this page, is edited as regular files. Development is done in collaboration with LLM.</p>
