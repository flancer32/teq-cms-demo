<h1>About the Project</h1>
<p><strong>TeqCMS</strong> is a minimalist CMS for Node.js websites with support for multilingual content, SSR, and automatic translations via LLM. The project was created as internal infrastructure for <a href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com/" target="_blank">NutriLog</a> — an extension for custom GPT chat.</p>

<p>The main goal is to have a git-managed website with SEO-friendly URLs and built-in AI localization. To achieve this without excessive architecture, the CMS is based solely on its own <a href="https://github.com/teqfw/di" target="_blank"><code>@teqfw/di</code></a> module, which implements dependency injection in pure JavaScript without TypeScript or third-party frameworks.</p>

<p>The code was developed solo with active use of language models (GPT Web UI, DeepSeek API). Nearly every project file went through an LLM dialogue. JSDoc annotations are actively used to form local cognitive context.</p>

<p>Developing core packages and integrating with the demo server took about a week and a half. This was followed by content creation and feature expansion:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flancer32/teq-web" target="_blank">teq-web</a> — web part (routing, Node.js server)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flancer32/teq-tmpl" target="_blank">teq-tmpl</a> — templates and rendering</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flancer32/teq-cms" target="_blank">teq-cms</a> — CMS functionality</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flancer32/teq-cms-demo" target="_blank">teq-cms-demo</a> — example website</li>
</ul>

<p>TeqCMS works with any Node.js-based server (Express, Fastify, etc.), as well as directly via HTTP modules. Built-in support for Mustache and Nunjucks templating engines — this list can be easily extended.</p>
