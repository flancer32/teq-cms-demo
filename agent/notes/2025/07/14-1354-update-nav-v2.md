# Task: Update Russian v2 navigation

## Summary

Added links to all documentation pages under `tmpl/web/ru/v2/docs/`.
This ensures every page in the v2 structure is reachable from the navigation menu.

## Observations

- Previously missing pages like `cli.html` and `plugins.html` are now present.
- Navigation structure is still simple: single-level examples and docs sections.

## Suggestions

- Consider ordering docs logically or by importance once real content is added.
