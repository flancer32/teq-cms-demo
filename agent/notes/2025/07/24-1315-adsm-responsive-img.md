# Task: Make ADSM scheme responsive

## Summary
- Added `max-width:100%` and `height:auto` inline styles to the schema image in Russian and English ADSM pages.
- Ensures the diagram scales on mobile screens and no longer overflows.

## Observations
- Other pages already used the same responsive style for images.

## Suggestions
- Consider adding a global CSS class for responsive images to avoid inline styles.
