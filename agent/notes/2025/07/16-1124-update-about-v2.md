# Task: Generate Russian v2 about page

## Summary

Created content for `tmpl/web/ru/v2/about.html` following guidelines from `about.gen.md`. The page now describes the promo site purpose, structure and target audience in clear bullet lists.

## Observations

- `ctx` directory was added to the workspace for context; added it to `.gitignore` to avoid committing.
- Translation command fails due to missing OpenAI API key.

## Suggestions

- Once translations are configured, run `npm run translate` to keep locales in sync.
