# Task: Add missing contacts page and links

## Summary
- Created `contacts.html` in `tmpl/web/ru/v2/` and `tmpl/web/en/v2/`.
- Updated Russian and English navigators (`nav-v2.html`) to link to the new page.

## Observations
- The structure documentation lists `contacts.html` under `/v2/` but it was absent in both locales.
- Navigation menus lacked a link to this page.

## Suggestions
- Review existing links on `index.html` that reference non-existent `v2/features.html`.
