# Task: Align author photo and text

## Summary
- Adjusted `.author-block` CSS to enforce single-line layout using flexbox.
- Added `.author-text` wrapper in contact templates for both languages and versions.
- Updated mobile styles to stack elements vertically.

## Observations
- Running translation script fails due to missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
