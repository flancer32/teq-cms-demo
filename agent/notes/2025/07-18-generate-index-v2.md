# Task: Generate ru/en index page

## Summary

Created new content for `tmpl/web/ru/v2/index.html` following `ctx/tmpl/web/ru/v2/index.gen.md`. Added first-person exposition of the KUS (AISM) approach with sections on architecture, workflow, advantages and target audience. Updated `tmpl/web/en/v2/index.html` with an English version using AISM terminology.

## Observations

- Both pages now contain structured sections and tables as required by the context.
- Inserted AGENT comment to mark regeneration.

## Suggestions

- Review translations after running the automated localization command to ensure consistency.
