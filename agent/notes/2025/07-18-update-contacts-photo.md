# Task: Update contacts page photo layout

## Summary
- Added author photo block in `contacts.html` for Russian and English locales.
- Converted CSS to use flex layout instead of floats for `.author-block`.

## Observations
- Previous page ignored instructions to show the author's photo next to the intro text.
- Flex layout adapts better for different screen widths.

## Suggestions
- Verify translation sync after updates to Russian pages.
