# Task: Rewrite about pages in first person

## Summary

Updated `tmpl/web/ru/v2/about.html` and `tmpl/web/en/v2/about.html` according to `ctx/tmpl/web/ru/v2/about.gen.md`. Both pages now speak from my perspective as the site creator and mention using OpenAI Codex. Mixed-language words were replaced.

## Observations

- Removed the old "Related resources" section and folded links into the "Попробуйте"/"Give it a try" blocks.
- Added bullet lists with first-person phrasing.
- `npm run start` prints nothing and was cancelled manually.

## Suggestions

- Clarify available CLI flags in documentation.
